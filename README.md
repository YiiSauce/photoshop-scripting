# photoshop-scripting
one of my favorite hobbies is designing with Photoshop and i always when i want to apply the same design for multiple pictures in Photoshop 
i have to copy all the layers from one to the other, or reply it from scratch and this maybe gonna takes a long time, so created a small script 
using JSX and based on the Adobe Photoshop Documentation to do that for me instead.
